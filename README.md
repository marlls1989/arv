# ARV Go High-level Functional Model #

The Asynchronous RISC-V (ARV) is a 7-stage superscalar asynchronous processor design.
It is designed using Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), a paradigm suitable for modelling asynchronous circuits abstracting handshake protocol and encoding details.

This repository contains the ARV high-level model written in [The Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/), which features channels and goroutine CSP-based constructs.
This model is used to develop the processor organisation, abstracting asynchronous specific design complexities.

## Installation Instructions

You will need the following packages installed before you start:
+ Go (minimal version 1.7)
+ Git (to fetch dependencies and the latest version)
+ GNU Toolchain for RISC-V (for building example code)

The instructions assume you are running a modern Unix-like environment, e.g. Linux or MacOS.

Retrieve the latest version from the repository:

	go get bitbucket.org/marcos_sartori/qdi-riscv

If you are installing from a tarball release, untar the contents in `src/bitbucket.org/marcos_sartori/qdi-riscv` in your `$GOPATH` directory:

	mkdir -p ${GOPATH}/src/bitbucket.org/marcos_sartori
	tar -xvf qdi-riscv-1.0.tar.bz2 -C ${GOPATH}/src/bitbucket.org/marcos_sartori
	go get bitbucket.org/marcos_sartori/qdi-riscv
	
In order to compile the code in `samplecode` and `riscv-tests` directories you first need to get [The GNU Toolchain for RISC-V](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain) dependencies before installing it:

	git clone --recursive https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain
	cd riscv-gnu-toolchain
	mkdir build
	cd build
	../configure --with-arch=rv32ima --with-abi=ilp32
	sudo make
	
## Running Code in the Model

After installing, you are ready to compile and run the included sample code:

	cd samplecode
	make
	qdi-riscv -memfile hanoi.bin

You can use the code provided in the `samplecode` directory to write your own programs targeting the simulation platform.
	
To run the RISC-V Unit Test Suite use:

	cd riscv-tests
	make
	qdi-riscv -memfile test.bin
	
For further options, including debug flags use:

	qdi-riscv -v
